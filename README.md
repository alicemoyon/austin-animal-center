# Running the notebook
In order to execute the code in the notebook, you need to create an Anaconda environment and install the python packages listed in the requirements file included in this repository.

If you do not have Anaconda already installed, you can download it here https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Once Ananconda is installed on your machine, you can then create a new conda environment with the required packages by running the following on the command line: conda create --name yourenvname --file conda_comp47350py37_requirements_03052020.txt
